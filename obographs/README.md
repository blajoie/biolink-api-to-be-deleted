# obographs - a python API for working with ontology graphs

NOTE: This is a standalone module currently in the biolink-api
repo. It does not depend on any other module in this repo (other than
prefixcommons), and will be moved to its own repo.

Thhis module provides a general purpose Ontology object that is bound
to either remote services, PURLs or a local file, and provides various
operations on these objects, including extraction to trees and
subgraphs. See the command line examples below for a general picture.

There are two ways of initiating an ontology object:

 * via a local obo-json file
 * via remote connections to OBO PURLs
 * via remote query to a SPARQL service (currently  ontobee, but soon others)

Persistent caching is used (currently cachier) to avoid repeated expensive I/O connections

This is handled via the [ontol_manager.py](ontol_manager.py)
module. This creates an ontology object (see [ontol.py](ontol.py) ).

Note that object modeling is lightweight - we use the python networkx
package for representing the basic graph portion of an ontology. See
also the [obographs](https://github.com/geneontology/obographs) spec.



# Command Line Usage

## Initial Setup

```
export PATH $HOME/repos/bioink-api/obographs/bin
ogr -h
```

Note you need to be connected to a network

Note: command line interface may change

## Connecting to ontologies

Specify an ontology with the `-r` option. this will always be the OBO name, for example `go`, `cl`, `mp`, etc

 * `-r go` connect to GO via default method (currently SPARQL)
 * `-r obo:go` connect to GO via download and cache of ontology from PURL
 * `-r /users/my/my-ontologies/go.json` use local download of ontology

In the following we assume default method, but can be substituted.

## Ancestors queries

List all ancestors:

```
ogr -r cl neuron
```

Show ancestors as tree, following only subclass:

```
ogr -r cl -p subClassOf -t tree neuron
```

generates:

```
     % GO:0005623 ! cell
      % CL:0000003 ! native cell
       % CL:0000255 ! eukaryotic cell
        % CL:0000548 ! animal cell
         % CL:0002319 ! neural cell
          % CL:0000540 ! neuron * 
       % CL:0002371 ! somatic cell
        % CL:0002319 ! neural cell
         % CL:0000540 ! neuron * 
```

Descendants of neuron, parts and subtypes

```
ogr -r cl -p subClassOf -p BFO:0000050 -t tree -d d neuron
```

Descendants and ancestors of neuron, parts and subtypes

```
ogr -r cl -p subClassOf -p BFO:0000050 -t tree -d du neuron
```

## Visualization using obographviz

Requires: https://www.npmjs.com/package/obographviz

Add og2dot.js to path

```
ogr -p subClassOf BFO:0000050 -r go -t png   a nucleus
```

This proceeds by:

 1. Using the python obographs library to extract a networkx subgraph around the specified node
 2. Write as obographs-json
 3. Calls og2dot.js

Output:

## Search

List exact matches to neuron

```
ogr -r cl neuron
```

Terms starting with neuron, SQL style

```
ogr -r cl neuron%
```

Terms starting with neuron, regex (equivalent to above)

```
ogr -r cl -s r ^neuron
```

Terms ending with neuron

```
ogr -r cl -s r neuron$
```

Terms containing the string neuron

```
ogr -r cl -s r neuron
```

Note: any of the above can be fed into other renderers, e.g. trees, graphs

E.g. terms containing neuron, to obo

```
ogr -r cl %neuron% -t obo
```

E.g. terms ending neuron, to tree

```
ogr -r cl %neuron -t tree
```
